# Linear Algebra For Data Science - Moore Penrose Pseudoinverse
This resource explains the Moore Penrose Pseudoinverse, a classic Linear Algebra topic. It is used to find the inverse of a
system of overdetermined matrix (or equations).
There is direct application of the pseudoinverse in identifying the best fit line. It is used to find the inverse for 
solving the parameters of Linear Regression.
